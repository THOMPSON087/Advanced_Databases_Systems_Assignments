Alias and Concatenation

1 Retrieve a list of employee names with a concatenated full name (first name + last name), and alias the column as "Full Name".

SELECT first_name, last_name, first_name || ' ' || last_name AS "Full Name"
FROM employees;

2 Retrieve a list of employees with their first name, last name, and a concatenated string including their first name, a space, and the first three characters of their last name. Alias it as "Abbreviated Name".


SELECT first_name, last_name, first_name || ' ' || SUBSTR(last_name, 1, 3) AS "Abbreviated Name"
FROM employees;

3 Query to display employee IDs, first names, and last names of employees with an 'e' in their first name. Concatenate first name and last name, aliasing as "Full Name".


SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, first_name || ' ' || last_name AS "Full Name"
FROM employees
WHERE INSTR(first_name, 'e') > 0;

4 Retrieve employee details with employee ID, last name, and a concatenated string of the last two digits of employee ID, a hyphen, and the first three characters of last name. Alias as "ID-Name".


SELECT employee_id, last_name, SUBSTR(employee_id, -2) || '-' || SUBSTR(last_name, 1, 3) AS "ID-Name"
FROM employees;

5 Display employee IDs, first names, and last names in a single column with a custom format. Alias as "Custom ID".


    SELECT employee_id || '-' || SUBSTR(first_name, 1, 2) || '-' || SUBSTR(last_name, -2) AS "Custom ID"
    FROM employees;

Filtering, Relational Operators, and Logical Operators

1 Retrieve employee details (employee_id, first_name, last_name, hire_date) of those hired after employee with ID 100, and with a salary >= 5000.


SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, hire_date
FROM employees
WHERE hire_date > (SELECT hire_date FROM employees WHERE employee_id = 100)
  AND salary >= 5000;

2 Display employee details (employee_id, first_name, last_name) of employees in department 20 or with salary > 8000.


SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = 20 OR salary > 8000;

3 Display employee IDs, first names, and last names of employees with salary > 6000 or hired before the year 2000.


SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 6000 OR hire_date < TO_DATE('2000-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD');

4 Retrieve employee details (employee_id, first_name, last_name) of employees without a manager (manager_id is NULL) and with job title containing "CLERK".


SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE manager_id IS NULL AND job_title LIKE '%CLERK%';

5 Display employee details (employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary) for employees with a salary > 8000 or in department 30 and hired after 2005.


    SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary
    FROM employees
    WHERE (salary > 8000) OR (department_id = 30 AND hire_date > TO_DATE('2005-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD'));
